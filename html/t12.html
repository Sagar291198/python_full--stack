    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod">
        Arthropods (/ˈɑːrθrəˌpɒd/ AR-thrə-pod)[3][4] are invertebrates in the phylum Arthropoda. They possess an exoskeleton with a cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate, a body with differentiated (metameric) segments, and paired jointed appendages. In order to keep growing, they must go through stages of moulting, a process by which they shed their exoskeleton to reveal a new one. They form an extremely diverse group of up to ten million species.
